First basic browser program made with Visual Studio Code. I used MDN as a reference point to understand how JavaScript works.

I divided HTML and JavaScript into their own files, as that was something I was led to understand as a good habit to use. 
After testing and seeing the results and taken into account that I do not have any previous experience in programming, I felt a really powerful sensation of success!

This is a really strong stepping point on continuing to learn how to program.
